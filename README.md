# Chasse Express

**Chasse Express** is a 2D skill game developed in **Python** with **Pygame**. Play as a hunter accompanied by your loyal Sheltie dog, whose bark makes magpies appear and scares them away! Aim carefully and capture the required number of magpies before time runs out.

## 🎮 Overview

In Chasse Express, your goal is simple: **catch the magpies before time runs out.**
Your Sheltie doesn’t hunt, but he is your ally: **click on the dog to make him bark**, which brings the magpies out and sets them in motion. Then, aim and shoot at the magpies as they fly across the screen!
⚠️ Attention: you have a limited number of bullets and a countdown timer.

This game is a personal and modern reinterpretation inspired by the legendary **Duck Hunt**, which marked an entire generation of players.
